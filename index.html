                        My name is Artem (Arty√≥m) Pankin. I am an urban researcher and an incoming Master of City and Regional Planning student at Rutgers University's Bloustein School, 
                        where I also serve as a Graduate Assistant at the Center for Urban Policy Research (CUPR). I hold a B.A. in Urban Studies and a Certificate in Spatial Data Science from Hunter College (2025).

                <p>
                    I am mixed-methods researcher who works at the intersection of cities, technology, and the environment. I am particularly interested in the following areas:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Climate urbanism and climate change</li>
                    <li>Urban data science, GIS and Machine Learning (ML) applications</li>
                    <li>Urban technologies and infrastructures</li>
                    <li>Science and Technology Studies (STS), Critical Data Studies, and More-than-human turn</li>
                </ol>
                <p> 
                    For the past two years, I have worked at the CUNY Research Foundation developing the Urban Heat Portal, which provides planners, advocates, and communities with access to urban heat data. There, I was primarily responsible for urban heat science and machine learning models for urban heat forecasting.
                    <br />
                    Recently, I've been engaged in the projects on green or climate technologies, trying to understand how they act as drives of urban growth and what type of logics they bring to the urban environment. This project resulted in the senior thesis titled "Climate Ambition Meets Urban Aspiration: Green Tech and Urban Growth in New York City" made via The Mellon Public Humanities and Social Justice (MPHSJ) Scholars Program under supervision of Dr. Lily Baum Pollans. I am currently working on a publication based on this thesis.
